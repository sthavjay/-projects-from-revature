This is owned project by Revature where we had to build, test and deploy files using Jenkins files and also had to use terraform for creating a infrastructure resources in EC2. In addition, we had to use dockerfiles for containerization and imaging. Other than that, we create monitoring tools files like prometheus, loki and grafana.yml files.  Also Used kubernetes as a automated tools for scaling and managing containerized applications.
